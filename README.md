### Continued development

This was a fantastic opportunity to approach front-end development with a mobile-first and bottom-up approach - something which made the process a lot more paletable. My major roadblocks with the bottom-up approach, however, was keeping consistency between design decicions, being only able to solve them when the components were put together and I could see the differences. There are a couple quirks with the desktop design, I think the padding and margins could be altered to match the design spec. I also need to review semantic HTML again, as there is is still confusion on how and when to use the appropriate markup. However, overall, I'm pleased with the result.
